# Sample Client for TaaS Public Endpoint

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.3. Run `npm i -g @angular/cli` to install angular CLI globally.

## How to create your TaaS Endpoint 

To create your own TaaS endpoint please head to [TezosLive.io](https://wwww.tezoslive.io). You can also try running the sample application with our default endpoint.

## How to run

Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies. 
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
